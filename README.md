Simple Notes
============

_[WIP: THIS PROJECT IS A PROTOTYPE AND IT MAY NOT BE IN A USABLE STATE YET]_

This app is part of the _Simple Apps_ suite: a series of minimal self-hostable
web apps designed to improve your productivity without compromising on security
and privacy.

This is _Simple Notes_: a simple replacement for Google Keep.


## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional)
* [ESLint for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) (optional)


## Getting Started

* Install all development dependencies with `pnpm install`;
* Start the development server with `pnpm run dev`.

The development server is accessible at http://localhost:5173/.

Hot reload is enabled, so any change to the source will be reflected immediately
to the running application.


## Building

* Install all development dependencies with `pnpm install`;
* Build with `pnpm run build`.

The build output is in the _dist_ directory.
